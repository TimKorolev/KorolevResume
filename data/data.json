  "aboutMe": "<p> My QA story began almost 2 years ago. I was hired as a testing engineer and worked in a project where I needed the skills of testing documentation, drawing up checklists and test cases for documentation (sometimes not for documentation). In the project, I mostly engaged in manual UI testing, but there were cases with API, for testing we used tools such as Fiddler and Postman. After six months of work, I was transferred to the staff of auto testers. Where the UI test framework was issued, on which I had to study C# and Selenium.</p><p>In the next project, our team wrote a Java framework from scratch using Junit, Selenide, Gherkin and JBehave. For reports, we used Allure. I also took on a small part of CI (Jenkins). With the development of the framework, we began to write tests for the UI using Selenide.</p><p>I plan to further develop in the field of testing as a specialist. I would like to work in a company that is known worldwide for its quality products.</p>"
